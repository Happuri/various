Various smaller projects, patches to FOSS tools etc.


Licence might be different for each project.

My work (patches) are public domain where it's allowed for you by your law jurisdiction 
and licence of the orginal work in my law jurisdiction (in short: I release code as it, 
I will not care how you use it, and I'm not a lawyer :)
